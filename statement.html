        PROJECT STATEMENT<br/><br/>

    <div class="paragraph">

        <br/> This project began from seeing an upside down tree floating in the sky in August of 2020 from the fire escape of my apartment in Brooklyn. Strangely, later that day, a stranger on social media uploaded a picture of the glitch I saw, but from a highway in California.<br/><br/>

The topic of alternate realities or a multiverse is one many people are familiar with, whether through television shows or books. I wanted to visualize my own theories of what those places look like, the laws that govern them, and the in-betweens.<br/><br/>

Ages like 19, 29, 39, and on embody the concept that previously unimaginable events like dimension travelling can happen then and only then. This is due to the fact that 9 is the closest lower number to 10, a divine number representing perfection, maximum creativity, and wholeness. 9 is almost there, but not quite, resulting in a fractured and chaotic multiverse that becomes accessible.<br/><br/>

Travel through this guide book to visit dimensions generated each day for 29 days.
